# I-Like-Trains


* This project will connect to firebase, and will log information about trains coming and going.
* The user will input some info about trains:
  - Train Name
  - Destination
  - First Train Time
  - Train Frequency in minutes
* The info will then be logged into a "Current Schedule" table for the user to see, and saved in the database.
